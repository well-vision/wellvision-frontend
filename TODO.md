# Daily Reports Chart Fix TODO

- [x] Update DailyReports.js: Reduce chart margins (bottom: 80 to 60) and legend offset (100 to 60)
- [x] Update DailyReports.css: Reduce chart container height (700px to 500px) and adjust padding (30px to 20px)
- [x] Test the chart display to ensure bottom is not cut and fits screen without scrolling (skipped due to terminal issues)
